Design a pitch deck for a startup "ResQ Cloud" that allows companies to take total control over their non-cloud infrastructure and manage private cloud.
The main features are:
* mass monitor target nodes even when the network's down
* alert when target nodes are not operating as expected
* control target nodes even when the network's down
* integration with BCMS
* integration with observability tools
* mass control nodes using scripting
  * remediate kernel level crashes
  * unattended remediation known and unknown future vulnerabilities
* re/install OS even when the network's down
* take/restore snapshots of last working states
* automate the management of bare metal
* build/manage private cloud
* detect/alert ransomware
* detect/alert virus attacks
* detect/alert rootkit
* detect/alert on possible threats from phishing (PDR)
* detect security vulnerability with EDR (openEDR)
* detect compliance
* all features are non-intrusive so even if this these sidecar node go down it won't bring down the target nodes

These features enable the following:
* 100% business resiliency and continuity in the non-cloud infrastructure.
* build/manage private cloud
