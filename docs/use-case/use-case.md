Come up with KVM scenarios

* mass monitor target nodes even when the network's down
* alert when target nodes are not operating as expected
* control target nodes even when the network's down
* integration with BCMS
* integration with observability tools
* mass control nodes using scripting
  * remediate kernel level crashes
  * unattended remediation known and unknown future vulnerabilities
* re/install OS even when the network's down
* take/restore snapshots of last working states 
* automate the management of bare metal
* build/manage private cloud
* detect/alert ransomware
* detect/alert virus attacks
* detect/alert rootkit
* detect/alert on possible threats from phishing (PDR)
* detect security vulnerability with EDR (openEDR)
* detect compliance 
* all features are non-intrusive so even if this these sidecar node go down it won't bring down the target nodes
